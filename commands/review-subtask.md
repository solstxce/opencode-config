description: Review current changes against the active plan sub-task.
---

Review the current branch changes against the repository's default or agreed base branch using `.agents/tasks/plan.md` as the source of truth. Focus on the single sub-task marked `In Progress`; if multiple sub-tasks are marked `In Progress`, review the one the current changes most clearly implement and state that assumption in the review. If none is marked `In Progress`, use the single sub-task that the current changes most clearly implement and state that assumption in the review. Evaluate the diff against that sub-task's related requirements, dependencies, scope boundaries, risks, implementation suggestions, testing guidance, and done-when criteria. Check for correctness issues, regressions, duplication, missing validation, scope creep, and opportunities to simplify. Write the feedback in `.agents/tasks/review.md` using the `code-review` skill.
